<h4>Unofficial skroutz.gr basket</h4>
This a custom basket for skroutz.gr
<br>
The official basket allows you to collect items only from some special categories.<br> 
You can collect items, create and share list with your friends.<br>
<br>
In the total price the shipping is not included.
<br>
Use with your own risk.

You can check the site here. BUT!<br>
It is hosted on a free host provider so there are some limitation. <br>
For example, python can't interact with skroutz directly so I use a proxy for the requests.<br>
Because of proxy, there is a dalay, sometimes proxy is down...
